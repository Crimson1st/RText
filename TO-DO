- Very basic variable code completion for Groovy.
- Fix bug - new tools aren't always remembered (? still true?)


UI Features
-----------
1.  Add option to have Find/Replace in Files syntax highlight matches.
2.  Create better icons for file types.


Functionality
-------------
1.  Add XML validation (squiggle underlining).
2.  Add scripted macro support (Java 6+ only).
3.  Add VB syntax highlighting.
4.  Add drag-and-drop support to list view (rearranging files, opening).
4.  Make OptionsDialogPanels lazy-initialize on first display.
5.  Provide Exuberant ctags with Windows install.


Miscellaney
-----------
1.  Update localizations.
2.  Optimize printing code.
3.  Add color printing option.
4.  Make auto-indentation configurable and remembered as well.


Bugs that nobody cares about
----------------------------
1.  Icons view doesn't update encoding selection.
2.  Inserting spaces in WrappedSyntaxView at the end of a wrapped line
    messes up.


Probably won't happen
---------------------
1.  WW:  Make WrappedSyntaxView implement TokenOrientedView so that
    it could use the more efficient RSyntaxUtilities.getNextVisualPositionFrom
    instead of View's version (which calls Utilities.getPositionAbove/Below,
    which are very inefficient because of multiple calls to modelToView).
2.  WW: Make tokens with whitespace break at whitespace boundaries too
    (e.g. MLC's)!
3.  Make plugins have their own help that gets added dynamically to RText's.
4.  Make plugins add options to options dialog dynamically.  This and (3) are
    tough because the user can open Help/Options before all plugins have loaded.
