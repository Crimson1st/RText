UI Features
-----------
1.  Add option to have Find/Replace in Files syntax highlight matches.
2.  Create better icons for file types.


Functionality
-------------
1.  Add XML validation (squiggle underlining).
2.  Add scripted macro support (Java 6+ only).
3.  Add VB syntax highlighting.
4.  Add drag-and-drop support to list view (rearranging files, opening).
5.  Add right-click menu to list view (close file, properties, etc.).
6.  Make list view a DockableWindow so it's grouped with docked plugins.
7.  Make OptionsDialogPanels lazy-initialize on first display.
8.  If Source Browser isn't configured for ctags location, make context menu
    contain a single item "Configure ctags...".  Requires Options dialog API
    to display a specific option panel.
9.  Provide Exuberant ctags with Windows install.


Miscellaney

1.  Update localizations.
2.  Optimize printing code.
3.  Add color printing option.
4.  Make auto-indentation configurable and remembered as well.


Bugs that nobody cares about
----------------------------
1.  Icons view doesn't update encoding selection.
2.  Inserting spaces in WrappedSyntaxView at the end of a wrapped line
    messes up.


Probably won't happen
---------------------
1.  WW:  Make WrappedSyntaxView implement TokenOrientedView so that
    it could use the more efficient RSyntaxUtilities.getNextVisualPositionFrom
    instead of View's version (which calls Utilities.getPositionAbove/Below,
    which are very inefficient because of multiple calls to modelToView).
2.  WW: Make tokens with whitespace break at whitespace boundaries too
    (e.g. MLC's)!
3.  Make plugins have their own help that gets added dynamically to RText's.
