UI Features
-----------
1.  Rearrange editor options to be more intuitive.


Functionality
-------------
1.  Make directory for Rhino user-defined scripts that get run on startup (this
    would require Java 6, of course).
2.  Add VB syntax highlighting.
3.  Add drag-and-drop support to list view (rearranging files, opening).
4.  Change file list view from an AbstractMainView to just an optional
    dockable window ("Open Files" window).
5.  Make OptionsDialogPanels lazy-initialize on first display.
6.  Provide Exuberant ctags with Windows install.
7.  Improve Help!  Especially for new tool & macro support, startup scripts
    (above), etc.


Miscellaney
-----------
1.  Update localizations.
2.  Optimize printing code.
3.  Add color printing option.
4.  Make auto-indentation configurable and remembered as well.


Bugs that nobody cares about
----------------------------
1.  Icons view doesn't update encoding selection.
2.  Inserting spaces in WrappedSyntaxView at the end of a wrapped line
    messes up.


Probably won't happen
---------------------
1.  WW:  Make WrappedSyntaxView implement TokenOrientedView so that
    it could use the more efficient RSyntaxUtilities.getNextVisualPositionFrom
    instead of View's version (which calls Utilities.getPositionAbove/Below,
    which are very inefficient because of multiple calls to modelToView).
2.  WW: Make tokens with whitespace break at whitespace boundaries too
    (e.g. MLC's)!
3.  Make plugins have their own help that gets added dynamically to RText's.
    Tough because the user can open Help/Options before all plugins have loaded.
