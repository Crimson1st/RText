<!--
    This file contains all 3rd party Swing Look and Feels that will appear
    in RText's Look and Feel menu.

    If you want a 3rd party Look and Feel (such as the JGoodies looks or
    Kunststoff), you must add it here.  The format is as follows:
       <LookAndFeel name="<name>" class="<class>" jar="<jar>"/>
    where:
       <name> is the Look and Feel's name (preferably from lnf.getName()).
       <class> is the Look and Feel's main class.
       <jar> is the jar file containing the Look and Feel.  This path
             should be relative to the RText installation directory.

    An example:  For the JGoodies Plastic look and feel, place the Look's
    jar file (e.g. looks-1.3.jar) under RText's "lnfs" directory and add
    the following line below:
        <LookAndFeel name="JGoodies Plastic"
           class="com.jgoodies.looks.plastic.PlasticLookAndFeel"
           jar="lnfs/looks-1.3.jar"/>
